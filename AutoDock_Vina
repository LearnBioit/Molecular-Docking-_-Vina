###########################  HOW TO PERFORM AUTODOCK_VINA? #############################
The vina can be performed by the following two methods:

1. Prepare the conf.txt file
- Open the conf.txt file in a text editor.
- Edit the pdbqt file names for the receptor protein and ligands.
- Specify the grid size (x, y, z) and center (x, y, z) coordinates.
        + If you have completed a previous AutoDock run, you can get these values from the protein.gpf file.
-You can also create the conf.txt file manually in a text editor like Notepad.
-Be very careful with spacing and use lowercase letters, as AutoDock is sensitive to formatting.

2. Perform AutoDock Vina

-Create a folder called "Vina" or "Vina Docking" to contain the files.
-Place the following files in the folder:
       + conf.txt
       + racoon (The racoon program can help generate the pdbqt files needed for docking.)
       + A shell script file (.sh) to set the file paths
       + For example: C:/cygwin64/home/vina/vina
- Place the "Vina" folder in this path: C:/cygwin64/home/vina/vina
- The vina executable file will perform the actual docking calculations.

- You need to prepare the conf.txt file with the correct file names and grid settings, 
then run the vina executable in a folder containing the necessary input files. 

Finally,

# In cygwin terminal                     #
# set the path and run the shell script: #
# sh vina_screen_loca.sh                 #

----------------Analysis---------------------------
-Analyzing the Results in AutoDockTools
-Open AutoDockTools.
-Go to Analyze > Docking > Open AutoDock Vina Results.
-Select the out.pdbqt file generated by vina.

-Go to Analyze > Macromolecule and open the protein_clean.pdbqt file.

-Go to Docking > Show Interactions to visualize the interactions between the ligand and the protein.

#Carefully examine the different types of interactions (Pose no, Binding energy, hydrogen bonds, etc.) 
and note down your observations and conclusions.

By following these steps, you will be able to complete the AutoDock Vina docking process and analyze the results using AutoDockTools. 
Remember to carefully review the docking modes and their affinities, as well as the specific interactions between the ligand and the protein, 
to draw meaningful conclusions about the potential binding interactions.
